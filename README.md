*Arduino is a great open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible easy-to-use hardware and software. It is basically a simplified microcontroller, in the sense that it uses a normal microcontroller and envelopes its internal functioning which may impede its functioning, but it gives us a very handy, easy to use tool.
It syntax is simply **ESC101***
